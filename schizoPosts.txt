POV: you just killed all the passengers on your submarine now you have 3 weeks worth of air and plenty of food and all you can do is a little dance to celebrate
You and four other people were asked to test an experimental gas for a share of $1,000,000. The gas doesn't let you sleep. After five days, everyone has gone completely insane. One of the test subjects has been devoured. You sit there hiding after hearing you were the next source of food.
